### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I work on route planning algorithms for transportation networks, and sometimes on the problems that arise around it. 

ðŸ’¬ If you're looking to learn how map services work, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3wKfJAVRkg) an excellent talk, [here's](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05140) an excellent survey of algorithms, and please see [this](https://gist.github.com/PayasR/bc46af938195a827e42006c3f5544e4a) for a list of open-source implementations!

ðŸ˜„ My pronouns are he/him.
