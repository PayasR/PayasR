### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I work on route planning algorithms for transportation networks, and sometimes on the problems that arise around it. 

ðŸ’¬ If you're interested in learning how mapping services (GMaps/Apple Maps/OSRM/GraphHopper/XYZ Maps) work, there's an excellent survey of the field [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05140), and [here](https://gist.github.com/PayasR/bc46af938195a827e42006c3f5544e4a) is a list of open-source routing algorithm implementations.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning .Net Core, React.
